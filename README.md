# Dice Game Prank

I made this game as a prank for my nephew. Itâ€™s a simple dice game where two people argue, and the dice roll decides the winner. You just put in your names, and let the RNG settle things.

But hereâ€™s the fun part: when my nephew enters his name (Lucca), the dice roll only goes up to 2. ðŸ˜‚ So, he pretty much loses every time. =D

I built this game using some good old-fashioned vanilla CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

Enjoy, and may the dice roll in your favor!
