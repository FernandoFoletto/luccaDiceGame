# Dice Game Prank

I made this game as a prank for my nephew. It’s a simple dice game where two people argue, and the dice roll decides the winner. You just put in your names, and let the RNG settle things.

But here’s the fun part: when my nephew enters his name (Lucca), the dice roll only goes up to 2. 😂 So, he pretty much loses every time. It’s hilarious!

I built this game using some good old-fashioned vanilla CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. No fancy libraries, just pure classic web tech.

Enjoy, and may the dice roll in your favor!
